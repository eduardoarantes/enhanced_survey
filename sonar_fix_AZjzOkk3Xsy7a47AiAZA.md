Fix for SonarCloud issue AZjzOkk3Xsy7a47AiAZA:
- File: survey-tool/src/components/SurveyForm.tsx
- Line: 920  
- Rule: typescript:S2004
- Type: CODE_SMELL
- Message: Refactor this code to not nest functions more than 4 levels deep.

This is a placeholder implementation. A real implementation would:
1. Use task-executor-tdd agent to analyze the specific issue
2. Apply appropriate code changes based on the rule type
3. Ensure the fix maintains functionality and follows best practices
