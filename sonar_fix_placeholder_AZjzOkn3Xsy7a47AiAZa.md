# Placeholder Fix for SonarCloud Issue AZjzOkn3Xsy7a47AiAZa

**File:** backend/server.js
**Line:** 147  
**Rule:** javascript:S3776
**Type:** CODE_SMELL
**Message:** Refactor this function to reduce its Cognitive Complexity from 33 to the 15 allowed.

## Note
AI agent orchestration service was unavailable. This is a placeholder implementation.

A real implementation would:
1. Use AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini Pro, etc.) to analyze the specific issue
2. Apply appropriate code changes based on the rule type
3. Ensure the fix maintains functionality and follows best practices
4. Validate the fix using multi-layer validation
5. Provide rollback capabilities for safety

## Next Steps
- Verify AI service configuration
- Retry fix application when services are available
- Review and manually apply necessary changes if needed
