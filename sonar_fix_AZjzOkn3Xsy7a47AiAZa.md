Fix for SonarCloud issue AZjzOkn3Xsy7a47AiAZa:
- File: backend/server.js
- Line: 147  
- Rule: javascript:S3776
- Type: CODE_SMELL
- Message: Refactor this function to reduce its Cognitive Complexity from 33 to the 15 allowed.

This is a placeholder implementation. A real implementation would:
1. Use task-executor-tdd agent to analyze the specific issue
2. Apply appropriate code changes based on the rule type
3. Ensure the fix maintains functionality and follows best practices
