I want to create a simple survey tool that can be configured with a JSON file.
The questions can be of type:
- Text
- Multiple choice
- Single choice

for text questions, the user should be able to enter a text answer.
If the answer is not suficient to provide good details, he should be prompted for more information.

To test whether the answer is sufficient, the tool should be able to use a LLM to test the answer.
There will be a field on the page where the prompt for the LLM is configured.

The response from the LLM should be: 
- "sufficient" if the answer is sufficient
- "insufficient" if the answer is insufficient
    - In this case the LLM should provide a follow up question to ask the user for more information.

This follow up question will be added to the list of questions, just below the original question.

The LLM call should be done from the browser, using the OpenAI API.

There should be a field for the user to enter the OpenAI API key.

There should be a configuration to trigger the LLM call. 
The options are:
- When the text fiels loses focus and there is text in the field
- On submit

There is no need to save the answers to a database.

This is a frontend only tool for testing the LLM.

Everything should be able to be configured on the UI.

The questions and options should be a field with json (easy to edit)


The LLM prompt should have a rich editor
